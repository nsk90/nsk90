### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I love programming and doing it professionally sinse 2012. 
I have been working with different languages and stacks, started with __C++__ then moved to __Java__ and __Kotlin__.
Made different kind of apps like Linux console network servers, crossplatform desktop client-server apps, cryptographic libraries and Android fin-tech apps.
I also worked with lowlevel hardware devices like relay boards and smard-cards.
I have pretty much experience in libraries development, multithreading and application architecture.

Currently I'm working as Android technical leader and maintaining my pet project [KStateMachine](https://github.com/KStateMachine/kstatemachine) trying to provide the best APIs and code usage experience.
