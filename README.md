### Hi there 👋 
I love programming and doing it professionally sinse 2012. 
I have been working with different languages and stacks, started with __C++__ along with __Boost__ and __Qt__ libraries then moved to __Java__ and __Kotlin__.
Made different kind of apps like Linux console network TCP servers, crossplatform desktop client-server apps, cryptographic libraries and Android fin-tech apps.
I also worked with lowlevel hardware devices like relay boards and smart-cards, NFC and Bluetooth devices.
I have pretty much experience in libraries development, multithreading and application architecture.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Android technical leader
- 🦺 I’m maintaining my pet project [KStateMachine](https://github.com/KStateMachine/kstatemachine)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and interested in algorithmic trading of cryptocurrencies
